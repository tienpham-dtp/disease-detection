# disease-detection

Five days after meteors struck the DC metropolitan area, local hospitals have been flooded with people suffering from a virus that physicans have never seen before. Although they’re suspecting the virus might have been carried on or dispersed by the meteor, they’re not sure. What they do know is that left untreated, the disease is fatal within a few days, and it’s very easy to miss until the symptoms become extreme. The treatment is painful, but extremely effective if the disease is caught early. Consequently, early screening is critical to saving lives, and every misclassification means that someone either dies or suffers pain during the unnecessary treatment. There aren’t enough resources to treat everyone, so they need to predict who has the disease for treatment.
They’ve gathered some data from local populations using established questionnaires and lab tests, and physicians have spent extensive time to determine whether or not each patient is infected. Your task is to learn a model that can generalize to new patients. The description of the data can be found in README.txt. The labeled training data stored in CSV format in challengeTrainingLabeled.csv. Each patient is labeled as either being infected ‘1’ or not being infected ‘0’. We will not provide any further information on the data set or features.
